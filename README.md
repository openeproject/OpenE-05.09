# OpenE 05.09

This is the original OpenE code that I created. It was last updated in May 2019 and I won't
update it again, unless it's a few small things in this readme. The only reason I'm leaving this up
is because I'll probably find it cool to look back on in the future.

If you want to use OpenE, then please go to
[openeproject/OpenE](https://github.com/openeproject/OpenE-05.09) for the most recent GitHub repo or
head over to [openeproject.github.io/](https://openeproject.github.io/) for the website, to view all
the updates, blog posts, previous versions, current version and documentation.

Anyways, it was a lot of fun learning how to use GitHub with this repo (even though I'm still not
great at it) and I'm excited to keep working on this in the future on the other repo.
